##The Website For GamerGeek
I am a linguist. I study Linguistics unproffesionally; You can call me a self-taught linguist. You can also call me a WikiLinguist (I know Wikipedia isn't allways reliable, but I still use it). You most likely know me as GamerGeek (or some variant, but I'm starting to be more consistent), and if you know me by anything else, GO AWAY! I know how to use semicolons correctly; how cool is that?
Wait! This is the experimental website! Written in MarkDown! That's all I wanted to say. Goodbye!
